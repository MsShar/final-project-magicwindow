It was said that who ever gazed out of the magic window, if they believe, their imagination would take them to enchanted places where dreams can come true. Each day a line of people waited to look through the magic window. People came from near and far in hopes of having all of th deirreams fulfilled.</p>Slide to Page 2

  	 One day, an old woman in a wheelchair arrived at the castle to peer through the magic window.  She asked, “ Magic window, what do you see?” Suddenly, through the window, she saw a vision of herself young and lovely.  She was dancing in a radiant garden moving about like a beautiful ballerina.  The old woman became so joyful that her spirit lifted her out of the wheelchair.  She left the castle singing and dancing to the song from her vision. </p>Slide to Page three
